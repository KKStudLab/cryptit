CryptIt â€” is a simple and powerful cross-platform encryption tool, which can be used to protect your data from other people (like NSA, Government, Illuminati, big bro and so on) in the easiest possible way. 

Cryptographic security of encrypted files is based on [Advanced Encryption Standard]  (AES) algorithm in [CBC mode] with a key of 256-bits length.

To use cryptit you need to install python and pip on your personal computer, generate strong session password (for this step you can read useful article on [xkcd] site, it's very important) and then read following instructions bellow.

__How does it work?__

You choose the mode in which the program would be launched [encryption or decryption] and pass a path to target file or directory as an argument. After that, you generate strong password and type that password in the program. Then cryptit calculates hash ([SHA-3] 256) of your password and uses it as key for AES-256 in CBC mode.

> _Encryption has never been so easy!_

## Installation

### PyPI
To install CryptIt, run this command in your terminal:
```sh
$ pip install cryptit
```
This is the preferred method to install CryptIt, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

### Source files
In case you downloaded or cloned the source code from [GitHub] or your own fork, you can run the following to install cameo for development:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/KKStudLab/cryptit.git
$ cd cryptit
$ vitualenv --python=python[version] venv
$ source venv/bin/active
$ pip install --editable .
```
**Note**: _Don't forget about 'sudo'!_

## Basic Usage
Available command list:
```sh
$ cryptit -h
usage: cryptit [-h] [-e] [-d] [path]

positional arguments:
  path           path to target file or directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -e, --encrypt  encryption mode [by default]
  -d, --decrypt  decryption mode
```

### Encryption mode
To encrypt files on your PC open terminal and type following command, use -e option and put just path to target file or directory.
